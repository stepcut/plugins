Don's Haskell Libraries
-----------------------

* altdata
An alternative implementation of Typeable and Dynamic that
works in the presence of (completely) separate compilation

* hi
A parser for .hi files

* plugins
A dynamic loader for GHC-produce object files. Also provides type
checking of object interfaces via dynamic typing.

* eval
A system for reflecting strings of Haskell source into native code at
runtime, via runtime compilation and dynamic linking. 
Also implements a staged computation doo-hickey.

* printf
An implementation of printf(3) that uses eval to generate new Haskell
functions from format strings, at runtime, and dynamic typing to
retain type safety.
