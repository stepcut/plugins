.SH NAME
hs-plugins \- dynamic linker library for Haskell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ds c \fIhs-plugins\fP
\*c is a library for loading plugins written in Haskell into an
application at runtime. It also provides a mechanism for (re)compiling 
Haskell source at runtime. Thirdly, a combination of runtime compilation
and dynamic loading provides a suite of eval functions.  Values exported
by plugins are transparently available to Haskell host applications, and
bindings exist to use Haskell plugins from at least C and Objective C
programs. hs-plugins requires ghc-6.2.2 or greater.
