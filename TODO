For 0.1
----------

+ Cascading unload/reload

+ have eval, printf return errors as arguments, not to stdout

+ nice functions for cleaning up /tmp files, given a module name

+ PORTABILITY -- pretty much all of this is in main/SysTools.lhs in GHC
	-- where to /tmp files go? Use SysTools code from GHC
	-- need to dosify file names on in and out
	-- try to confirm the implementation of forkProcess

+ write a script to strip down the release code.

+ .hi file parser is broken on Itanium, again.

+ Implement hs_eval by marshalling Dynamics across to the C side for
  checking.

+ Make data structures used by the library Storable, for C programs

+ insert iface info into the state, building up a dependency graph like
  hram's. use this to allow cascading unloading. Does anyone want this?

+ enable more .hi interface code to provide full GHC-like :t options
  to plugs.
 
+ replace the String interface to eval with an ExpQ interface. 

+ build way=p and way=''
